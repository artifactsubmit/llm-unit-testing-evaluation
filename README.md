# Experimental Artifacts â€“ Evaluating LLM-Generated Unit Tests with Mutation Testing: ChatGPT vs DeepSeek

This repository contains all artifacts used in the experiment presented in the paper submitted to SBQS 2025, which aims to evaluate the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating unit tests in Java using mutation testing.

> **Note:** All artifacts will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

## Repository Structure

- `baseTestClasses(mutants)/`  
  Contains base test suites used solely to activate a fixed set of mutants generated by the PIT tool for each target class. These suites are not part of the LLM evaluation but ensure that all models are assessed against the same set of mutants, thus guaranteeing experiment reproducibility.

- `complexity-metrics/`  
  Files with cyclomatic complexity values of the target classes, used for the quantitative analysis in the experiment.

- `error-logs/`  
  Compilation and runtime error logs for the test suites generated by the LLMs, organized by class and model.

- `mutation-reports/`  
  Complete PIT (Mutation Testing) reports containing the results of mutation score and detection for each eligible test suite.

- `prompts/`  
  Files with the prompts used to generate test suites via the LLMs. Each prompt follows a standardized instruction format with variations per class.

- `target-classes/`  
  Original (non-instrumented) Java classes extracted from the Defects4J dataset, used as the basis for test generation.

- `test suites - LLMs/`  
  Test suites generated by ChatGPT and DeepSeek models, organized by class, model, and execution.

## Tools Used

- **JUnit 5**: Test framework used in the generated test suites.
- **PIT (Pitest)**: Mutation testing tool used to evaluate coverage and defect detection.
- **Maven**: Dependency manager and build automation tool used to compile projects, run tests, and integrate with PIT.
- **SonarQube**: Platform used for static code analysis and cyclomatic complexity calculation of target classes.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to organize, edit, run, and debug Java projects and test suites.
- **Defects4J**: Collection of real-world Java projects used as the source of the target classes in the experiment.
- **LLMs**: ChatGPT (GPT-4o) and DeepSeek V3 were used with standardized zero-shot prompting strategies.

## Experiment Execution

The experiment was conducted as follows:

1. Generation of unit tests via LLMs (5 runs per class/model) using the web interface.
2. Compilation and execution of the test suites.
3. Application of PIT to the valid suites to obtain Mutation Score and Mutation Coverage.
4. Analysis of runtime failures.
5. Consolidation of data into spreadsheets and generation of final reports.
